## Play Score Plugin (Core Plugin — Feature 033)

The **Play Score** plugin is a built-in full-screen plugin that lets users load, browse, and play back musical scores using Plugin API v3.

- **File loading**: Import `.mxl`, `.xml`, or `.musicxml` files directly from the device
- **Playback controls**: Play, Pause, Stop, and a live elapsed-time display (`mm:ss`)
- **Canvas tap**: Tap the score to toggle play/pause without the toolbar
- **Note seeking**: Short-tap a note to seek playback to that tick
- **Pin & loop**: Long-press a note to set a loop start pin; long-press a second note to create a loop region; long-press inside the loop to clear it
- **Return to start**: Dedicated button seeks to tick 0 (or to the pinned loop start if set)
- **Tempo control**: Slider adjusts playback speed from 0.5× to 2.0×
- **WASM loading state**: All controls are disabled while the audio engine initialises
