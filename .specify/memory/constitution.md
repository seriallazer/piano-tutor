# Musicore Constitution

## Project Context

**Musicore** is a tablet-native intelligent music stand for practice. The application serves musicians during practice sessions by providing high-fidelity score display, practice-oriented annotations, and performance assistance features. While score manipulation capabilities exist, they are scoped to practice workflows (markings, tempo adjustments, repeat navigation) rather than full composition/engraving.

**Target Users**: Practicing musicians (students, professionals, hobbyists) using tablets as digital music stands during rehearsal and performance preparation.

**Core Scenarios**: Score reading during practice, adding fingerings/bowings/markings, tempo/metronome integration, repeat/navigation aids, page turns, annotation sync across devices.

**Non-Goals**: Full music notation editor/engraver (e.g., Finale/Sibelius replacement), professional publishing, orchestral score layout.

---

## Core Principles

### I. Domain-Driven Design

The Music Timeline and all music entities MUST be modeled using Domain-Driven Design principles:

- **Ubiquitous Language**: All code, documentation, and discussions use consistent music domain terminology (Timeline, Event, Structural Event, Interval Event, PPQ, etc.)
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear separation between music engine core domain and infrastructure concerns
- **Aggregates**: Timeline acts as the aggregate root; all event modifications go through the Timeline
- **Entity Modeling**: Music concepts are first-class domain entities, not data structures

**Rationale**: Music practice tools require deep domain understanding of notation, performance techniques, and practice workflows. Technical abstractions must not leak into the problem space. DDD ensures the codebase speaks the language of musicians and music theory, whether displaying scores, processing annotations, or providing practice aids.

---

### II. Hexagonal Architecture

The backend MUST follow hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture:

- **Core Domain**: Music Timeline logic is independent of frameworks, databases, and UI
- **Ports**: Define interfaces for what the domain needs (persistence, events) and offers (commands, queries)
- **Adapters**: External systems (WASM bindings, storage) connect via adapters implementing ports
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies flow inward—core domain has zero external dependencies

**Rationale**: Music engine core must be technology-agnostic and testable in isolation. Architecture enables library-first development and prevents framework coupling. WASM bindings act as an adapter layer, preserving hexagonal boundaries.

---

### III. Progressive Web Application Architecture

The application MUST be architected as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) targeting tablet devices:

- **Target Platform**: Tablet devices (iPad, Surface, Android tablets) with modern browser support
- **WASM Deployment**: Rust music engine compiled to WebAssembly and executed in-browser via wasm-pack
- **Offline-First**: Core music stand operations (score parsing, display rendering, annotation, playback, practice aids) function without network connectivity
- **PWA Requirements**: Web app manifest, service worker for offline support, installable, responsive design optimized for tablet form factors
- **Client-Side Processing**: Domain logic (MusicXML parsing, score validation, annotation processing, practice utilities) runs locally via WASM module
- **Contract Definition**: TypeScript interfaces define contracts between WASM module and frontend (similar to API contracts)

**Rationale**: Tablet devices are the primary platform for digital music stands during practice sessions. Musicians require instant score loading, offline capability (practice rooms often lack reliable WiFi), and app-like experience. WASM enables deploying the Rust music engine directly in the browser, eliminating network latency (<100ms parse times vs 200-500ms with REST API) critical for seamless practice workflows. PWA architecture provides installable, offline-capable experience while maintaining web distribution simplicity and avoiding app store friction.

---

### IV. Precision & Fidelity

Music Timeline MUST operate at 960 PPQ (pulses per quarter note) resolution without precision loss:

- **Fixed Resolution**: 960 PPQ is immutable; no runtime resolution changes allowed
- **Integer Arithmetic**: All timing calculations use integer pulse counts—no floating-point timing
- **Structural Events**: Events without duration (time signature, tempo changes) anchored at exact pulse positions
- **Interval Events**: Events with duration (notes, chords) span exact pulse ranges

**Rationale**: Music timing is non-negotiable. Floating-point errors accumulate and destroy rhythmic accuracy. 960 PPQ is a MIDI standard that supports common musical subdivisions (triplets, 16th notes, 32nds).

---

### V. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All features follow strict Test-Driven Development:

- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write test → Verify it fails → Implement → Verify it passes → Clean up
- **No Code Without Tests**: Implementation PRs without corresponding tests are rejected
- **Contract Tests**: API endpoints require contract tests (backend provides what frontend expects)
- **Domain Tests**: Core music logic tested in isolation without infrastructure dependencies

**Rationale**: Music stand correctness is critical—wrong timing, notation display errors, or annotation failures break user trust during practice sessions. Tests document behavior, prevent regressions, and validate hexagonal boundaries.

---

## Technical Standards

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust (latest stable), Cargo workspace
- **WASM Compilation**: wasm-pack (latest), wasm-bindgen (for JS interop), target web
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, modern bundler (Vite/Webpack with WASM support)
- **Target Platform**: Tablet devices (iPad Pro, Surface Pro, Android tablets: Samsung Galaxy Tab, etc.) - Chrome 57+, Safari 11+, Edge 16+
- **PWA Infrastructure**: Web app manifest, service worker, IndexedDB for offline storage, responsive CSS (tablet-optimized breakpoints)
- **Repository**: Monorepo with `backend/` (Rust domain + WASM bindings) and `frontend/` (React PWA) directories
- **Package Management**: Cargo for Rust, npm/pnpm/yarn for JavaScript
- **Commit Conventions**: Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore)

### Code Quality

- **Rust**: Clippy lints enforced; `cargo fmt` on save; no `unsafe` without justification
- **React**: ESLint + Prettier configured; prop types or TypeScript strict mode
- **Documentation**: Public API surfaces documented (Rust doc comments, JSDoc/TSDoc)
- **Error Handling**: Rust `Result` types propagated; frontend errors shown with actionable messages

### Performance Constraints

- **Frontend Responsiveness**: User interactions (page turns, annotations, zoom) MUST reflect UI feedback within 16ms (60fps target)
- **WASM Operations**: Core music operations (parse, validate, annotation processing) MUST complete within 100ms for typical scores
- **Score Display**: Initial score rendering MUST complete within 200ms for practice session start
- **Offline Capability**: All practice features (score display, annotations, playback, metronome, practice aids) MUST work without network connectivity
- **Timeline Size**: Music engine MUST handle scores with 10,000+ events (large orchestral works, multi-movement pieces) without degradation
- **WASM Bundle Size**: Module bundle SHOULD be <500KB gzipped for fast initial load on tablets
- **Tablet Optimization**: Touch targets minimum 44×44px, gesture-friendly controls (pinch-zoom, swipe page turns), portrait/landscape support, legible notation at arm's length viewing distance

---

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch**: `main` is always deployable; protected with required reviews
- **Feature Branches**: All work happens in `feature/###-short-description` branches
- **PR Requirements**: Pull requests MUST include tests, pass CI, and update relevant specs

### Review Process

- **Code Reviews**: All PRs require at least one approval before merge
- **Constitution Compliance**: Reviewers verify adherence to principles (DDD, hexagonal, test-first)
- **Breaking Changes**: Any API contract changes flagged in PR description and require team discussion

### Quality Gates

- **CI Pipeline**: Tests (unit, integration, contract), lints, format checks
- **Test Coverage**: Not a hard threshold, but all critical paths MUST have test coverage
- **Benchmarks**: Performance-sensitive code includes benchmarks where applicable

---

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:

1. Documentation of proposed change with rationale
2. Team review and approval via PR to constitution file
3. Migration plan for affected code/specs if principle changes impact existing features

**Compliance Verification**: All PRs and code reviews MUST verify adherence to principles. Violations require explicit justification in commit messages or PR descriptions.

**Complexity Budget**: Introducing complexity (new dependencies, architecture patterns) requires demonstrating alignment with constitution or requesting an amendment.

**Runtime Guidance**: For implementation-specific guidance during feature development, refer to `.github/agents/` files (e.g., `speckit.implement.agent.md`).
